## Desription / objective 
The objective of this project is to design, develop, and deploy an AI-powered chatbot capable of
engaging in speech-based conversations with patients in the neurology department. The
chatbot will assist by:
1. Patient Screening: Asking preliminary health-related questions to collect key
information about symptoms, history, and concerns before their consultation.
2. Report Generation: Preparing a summary report for doctors to streamline patient
assessments.
3. Reception Assistance: Acting as a virtual receptionist to provide directions,
appointment confirmations, and general information about hospital services.
4. Multilingual Communication: Communicating in the patientâ€™s preferred language to
ensure inclusivity and ease of interaction for individuals from diverse linguistic
backgrounds.
